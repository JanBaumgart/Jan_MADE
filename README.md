# Correlation of the Covid-19 vaccination rate and the pupil in various school types and regions in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany

## Description of the project

![ProjectStockPic](https://github.com/JanBaumgart/Jan_MADE/blob/main/Stock-Pic_Corona_SH.jpg)

The project has the goal to untangle the connection between the COVID-19 vaccination rate and the number of cases in schools, respectively different regions of Schleswig-Holstein if there is one. 

By breaking down schools into types and SH into its regions / counties, I hope to gain insights or even find patterns. 
I will also combine the numbers and graphs with context in my analysis. 

The ultimate goal is to produce recommendations that can actually help in planning future vaccination or political projects to deal with pandemics in SH. 
So, this project is all about me making sense of things and finding useful suggestions for handling COVID-19 (or other diseases) in the future.
